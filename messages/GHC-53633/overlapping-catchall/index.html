<pre><code>Overlapping.hs:6:1: warning: [GHC-53633] [-Woverlapping-patterns]
    Pattern match is redundant
    In an equation for ‘f’: f _ = ...
  |
6 | f _ = False
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^</code></pre>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>In this case, all the patterns that can match a list were matched in the prior patterns, so the catch-all pattern in the last case will never be matched and is dead code.</p>
